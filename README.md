Titanic Data Analysis  

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, which provides insights into the passengers aboard the ill-fated ship. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that influenced survival rates, including features like age, gender, class, and fare.

The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations that help reveal trends and relationships between different variables in the dataset. The goal is to better understand the factors that influenced whether a passenger survived or perished.

Project Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis of individual features (univariate), relationships between features (bivariate), and interactions between multiple features (multivariate).
Data Visualizations: Graphical representations of key findings, including histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pair plots.
Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis to identify relationships between numerical variables.
Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this analysis can be found at:

Titanic Dataset on Kaggle
Running the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-data-analysis.git
cd titanic-data-analysis
Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script that contains the analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Titanic_Analysis.ipynb
Run the cells to view the analysis.

Example Output
The analysis will produce visualizations and key insights, including:

Distribution of age and fare.
Count of passengers by gender and survival status.
Correlation matrix to see relationships between numerical features.
Pair plots showing how different variables relate to survival.
Key Findings
Gender and Survival: Females had a higher survival rate than males.
Age and Survival: Children had a higher survival rate.
Class and Fare: Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had a higher survival rate, and they paid higher fares.
